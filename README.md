## Description
This application uses Express.js back end to save and review note data from a JSON file. When you arrive to the landing page you'll be presented with a "Getting Started" button. After clicking the button your be able to see any previous notes entered and enter new entries. This application was created to help small business owners write and save notes in order to organize their thoughts and to keep track of tasks needing to be completed.

This project allowed me to continue practice using NodeJS. I learned how to connect the back end to a database file and how to use GET/POST requests. I also learned how to use Heroku to deploy server based applications.
